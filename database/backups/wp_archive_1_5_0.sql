This year, we&#8217;re happy to be participating as a mentoring organization with two respected summer internship programs: <a href=\"http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013\">Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</a> and the Gnome Outreach Program for Women.</p>\n<h3>Google Summer of Code</h3>\n<p>GSoC is a summer internship program funded by Google specifically for college/university student developers to work on open source coding projects. We have participated in the Google Summer of Code program in the past, and have enjoyed the opportunity to work with students in this way. Some of our best core developers were GSoC students once upon a time!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013#Mentors\">Our mentors</a>, almost 30 talented developers with experience developing WordPress, will provide students with guidance and feedback over the course of the summer, culminating in the release of finished projects at the end of the program if all goes well.</p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the program earn $5,000 for their summer efforts. Interested, or know a college student (newly accepted to college counts, too) who should be? All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013\">GSoC 2013 page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<h3>Gnome Outreach Program for Women</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not news that women form a low percentage of contributors in most open source projects, and WordPress is no different. We have great women in the contributor community, including some in fairly visible roles, but we still have a lot of work to do to get a representative gender balance on par with our user base.</p>\n<p>The Gnome Outreach Program for Women aims to provide opportunities for women to participate in open source projects, and offers a similar stipend, but there are three key differences between GSoC and Gnome aside from the gender requirement for Gnome.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\">The Gnome program allows intern projects in many areas of contribution, not just code. In other words, interns can propose projects like documentation, community management, design, translation, or pretty much any area in which we have people contributing (including code).</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\">The Gnome Outreach Program for Women doesn&#8217;t require interns to be college students, though students are definitely welcome to participate. This means that women in all stages of life and career can take the opportunity to try working with open source communities for the summer.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\">We have to help raise the money to pay the interns. Google funds GSoC on its own, and we only have to provide our mentors&#8217; time. Gnome doesn&#8217;t have the same funding, so we need to pitch in to raise the money to cover our interns. If your company is interested in helping with this, please check out the program&#8217;s </span><a style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\" href=\"https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen#For_Organizations_and_Companies\">sponsorship information</a><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\"> and follow the contact instructions to get involved. You can earmark donations to support WordPress interns, or to support the program in general.

This year, we&#8217;re happy to be participating as a mentoring organization with two respected summer internship programs: <a href=\"http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2013\">Google Summer of Code (GSoC)</a> and the Gnome Outreach Program for Women.</p>\n<h3>Google Summer of Code</h3>\n<p>GSoC is a summer internship program funded by Google specifically for college/university student developers to work on open source coding projects. We have participated in the Google Summer of Code program in the past, and have enjoyed the opportunity to work with students in this way. Some of our best core developers were GSoC students once upon a time!</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013#Mentors\">Our mentors</a>, almost 30 talented developers with experience developing WordPress, will provide students with guidance and feedback over the course of the summer, culminating in the release of finished projects at the end of the program if all goes well.</p>\n<p>Students who successfully complete the program earn $5,000 for their summer efforts. Interested, or know a college student (newly accepted to college counts, too) who should be? All the information you need about our participation in the program, projects, mentors, and the application process is available on the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/GSoC2013\">GSoC 2013 page in the Codex</a>.</p>\n<h3>Gnome Outreach Program for Women</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s not news that women form a low percentage of contributors in most open source projects, and WordPress is no different. We have great women in the contributor community, including some in fairly visible roles, but we still have a lot of work to do to get a representative gender balance on par with our user base.</p>\n<p>The Gnome Outreach Program for Women aims to provide opportunities for women to participate in open source projects, and offers a similar stipend, but there are three key differences between GSoC and Gnome aside from the gender requirement for Gnome.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\">The Gnome program allows intern projects in many areas of contribution, not just code. In other words, interns can propose projects like documentation, community management, design, translation, or pretty much any area in which we have people contributing (including code).</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\">The Gnome Outreach Program for Women doesn&#8217;t require interns to be college students, though students are definitely welcome to participate. This means that women in all stages of life and career can take the opportunity to try working with open source communities for the summer.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\">We have to help raise the money to pay the interns. Google funds GSoC on its own, and we only have to provide our mentors&#8217; time. Gnome doesn&#8217;t have the same funding, so we need to pitch in to raise the money to cover our interns. If your company is interested in helping with this, please check out the program&#8217;s </span><a style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\" href=\"https://live.gnome.org/OutreachProgramForWomen#For_Organizations_and_Companies\">sponsorship information</a><span style=\"font-size: 13px;line-height: 19px\"> and follow the contact instructions to get involved. You can earmark donations to support WordPress interns, or to support the program in general.

Twenty Thirteen is an opinionated, color-rich, blog-centric theme that makes full use of the new Post Formats support.</li>\n<li><strong>Audio/Video:</strong> You can embed audio and video files into your posts without relying on a plugin or a third party media hosting service.</li>\n<li><strong>Autosave:Â </strong> Posts are now autosaved locally. If your browser crashes, your computer dies, or the server goes offline as you&#8217;re saving, you won&#8217;t lose the your post.</li>\n<li><strong>Post Locking:Â </strong> See when someone is currently editing a post, and kick them out of it if they fall asleep at the keyboard.</li>\n<li><strong>Nav Menus:Â </strong> Nav menus have been simplified with an accordion-based UI, and a separate tab for  bulk-assigning menus to locations.</li>\n<li><strong>Revisions:</strong> The all-new revisions UI features avatars, a slider that &#8220;scrubs&#8221; through history, and two-slider range comparisons.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Developers:Â </strong> You make WordPress awesome(er). One of the things we strive to do with every release is be compatible with existing plugins and themes. But we need your help. <strong>Please test your plugins and themes against 3.6.</strong> If something isn&#8217;t quite right, please let us know. (Chances are, it wasn&#8217;t intentional.) If you&#8217;re a forward-thinking theme developer, you should be looking at implementing the new Post Format support in some of your themes (look to Twenty Thirteen for inspiration).</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re looking forward to your feedback.Â If you break it (i.e. find a bug), please report it, and if youâ€™re a developer, try to help us fix it.Â We&#8217;ve already had more than 150 contributors to version 3.6 â€” it&#8217;s not too late to join the party!</p>\n\";}i:6;a:13:{s:5:\"title\";s:48:\"WordPress 3.5.1 Maintenance and Security Release\";s:4:\"link\";s:50:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/01/wordpress-3-5-1/\";s:8:\"comments\";s:59:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/01/wordpress-3-5-1/#comments\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Thu, 24 Jan 2013 22:23:03 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:12:\"Andrew Nacin\";}s:8:\"category\";s:16:\"ReleasesSecurity\";s:4:\"guid\";s:33:\"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2531\";s:11:\"description\";s:363:\"WordPress 3.5.1 is now available.

More cosmetic Â updates, like the introduction of branded plugin page headers, make it a nicer browsing experience, while functional changes like better-integrated support forums, plugin reviews, and a favorites system made the plugin directory even more useful as a resource.</p>\n<h4>The &#8220;Make&#8221; Network and Team Reps</h4>\n<p>2012 was the year that saw the creation of <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/\">Make.wordpress.org</a>, a network of sites for the teams of contributors responsible for the different areas of the WordPress project. Now anyone can follow along and get involved with the teams that work on <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/\">core</a>, <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/themes/\">theme review</a>, <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/support/\">forum support</a>, <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/docs/\">documentation</a>, and more. In 2013 we&#8217;ll work to improve these sites to make it easier to become a contributor. Each team also now has elected Team Reps, a new role that has already led to more cross-team communication. Team reps post each week to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/\">Updates blog</a> so that the other reps can keep up with what&#8217;s going on in other teams.</p>\n<h4>WordPress Community Summit</h4>\n<p>At the end of October, about 100 of the most influential and respected members of the WordPress community attended an inaugural <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/summit\">summit</a> to discuss where we all stand, and to figure out where we go next with WordPress. A &#8220;conference of conversations,&#8221; this unconference made everyone an active participant, and while not every issue brought to the table was solved by the end of the event, the right questions were being asked.</p>\n<h4>Meetup.com</h4>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation now has a central account with Meetup.com. We&#8217;ve brought in a couple dozen existing meetup groups as a pilot to test the system, and are in the process of working with more existing meetups (as well as new ones) to join us so that local organizers won&#8217;t have to pay organizer dues and can get more support from the WordPress project.</p>\n<h4>Internet Blackout Day</h4>\n<p>We participated in the protest against SOPA/PIPA, Internet Blackout Day, on January 18. Though we usually stay out of politics, this campaign was important, and we not only participated in the blackout on WordPress.org, we encouraged our users to do so as well, and recommended plugins to provide blackout functionality. It was deemed the <a href=\"http://sopastrike.com/numbers/\">largest online protest in history</a>.</p>\n<h4>WordCamps</h4>\n<p>And finally, it wouldn&#8217;t be a recap without counting up the <a href=\"http://wordcamp.org\">WordCamps</a>! There were 67 WordCamps around the world in 2012, bringing together WordPress users, developers, and fans.

Media has long been a friction point and we&#8217;ve listened hard and given a lot of thought into crafting this new system. 3.5 includes a new default theme, Twenty Twelve, which has a very clean mobile-first responsive design and works fantastic as a base for a CMS site. Finally we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time refreshing the styles of the dashboard, updating everything to be Retina-ready with beautiful high resolution graphics, a new color picker, and streamlining a couple of fewer-used sections of the admin.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick video overview of everything you can share with your friends:</p>\n<div id=\"v-jQDfEbzZ-1\" class=\"video-player\"><embed id=\"v-jQDfEbzZ-1-video\" src=\"http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=jQDfEbzZ&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"692\" height=\"388\" title=\"Introducing WordPress 3.5\" wmode=\"direct\" seamlesstabbing=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" overstretch=\"true\"></embed></div>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>You can now put your (or anyone&#8217;s) WordPress.org username on the plugins page and see your favorite tagged ones, to make it easy to install them again when setting up a new site. There&#8217;s a new Tumblr importer. New installs no longer show the links manager. Finally for multisite developers <code>switch_to_blog()</code> is way faster and you can now install MS in a sub-directory. The <a href=\"http://underscorejs.org/\">Underscore</a> and <a href=\"http://backbonejs.org/\">Backbone</a> JavaScript libraries are now available. <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5\">The Codex has a pretty good summary of the developer features above and beyond this</a>, and you can always <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.5\">grab a warm beverage and explore Trac directly</a>.</p>\n<h3>Percussion Section</h3>\n<p>Behind every great release is great contributors. 3.5 had more people involved than any release before it:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell\">Aaron D.

We&#8217;re calling this one &#8220;Elvin&#8221; in honor of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvin_Jones\">drummer Elvin Jones</a>, who played with John Coltrane in addition to many others.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve been around WordPress a while, the most dramatic new change you&#8217;ll notice is a completely re-imagined flow for uploading photos and creating galleries. Media has long been a friction point and we&#8217;ve listened hard and given a lot of thought into crafting this new system. 3.5 includes a new default theme, Twenty Twelve, which has a very clean mobile-first responsive design and works fantastic as a base for a CMS site. Finally we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time refreshing the styles of the dashboard, updating everything to be Retina-ready with beautiful high resolution graphics, a new color picker, and streamlining a couple of fewer-used sections of the admin.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick video overview of everything you can share with your friends:</p>\n<div id=\"v-jQDfEbzZ-1\" class=\"video-player\"><embed id=\"v-jQDfEbzZ-1-video\" src=\"http://s0.videopress.com/player.swf?v=1.03&amp;guid=jQDfEbzZ&amp;isDynamicSeeking=true\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"692\" height=\"388\" title=\"Introducing WordPress 3.5\" wmode=\"direct\" seamlesstabbing=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" overstretch=\"true\"></embed></div>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>You can now put your (or anyone&#8217;s) WordPress.org username on the plugins page and see your favorite tagged ones, to make it easy to install them again when setting up a new site. There&#8217;s a new Tumblr importer. New installs no longer show the links manager. Finally for multisite developers <code>switch_to_blog()</code> is way faster and you can now install MS in a sub-directory. The <a href=\"http://underscorejs.org/\">Underscore</a> and <a href=\"http://backbonejs.org/\">Backbone</a> JavaScript libraries are now available. <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_3.5\">The Codex has a pretty good summary of the developer features above and beyond this</a>, and you can always <a href=\"http://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/3.5\">grab a warm beverage and explore Trac directly</a>.</p>\n<h3>Percussion Section</h3>\n<p>Behind every great release is great contributors. 3.5 had more people involved than any release before it:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell\">Aaron D.

The standard operating procedure at the time for VC-backed companies consisted of bringing in &#8220;adult supervision,&#8221; founders often taking largely-ceremonial roles like &#8220;chief architect&#8221; after the business had scaled to a certain point, aggressive financial terms around liquidation preferences, and a control structure that more often than not left founders with a minority say in the future of the company, especially if it went through rough patches. Folks like <a href=\"http://www.trueventures.com/\">True Ventures</a> (who Automattic has always been intertwined with) appeared as iconoclasts because they came out saying that founders were the best ones to grow a company long-term and structuring their entire practice and way of investing around that idea.

The standard operating procedure at the time for VC-backed companies consisted of bringing in &#8220;adult supervision,&#8221; founders often taking largely-ceremonial roles like &#8220;chief architect&#8221; after the business had scaled to a certain point, aggressive financial terms around liquidation preferences, and a control structure that more often than not left founders with a minority say in the future of the company, especially if it went through rough patches. Folks like <a href=\"http://www.trueventures.com/\">True Ventures</a> (who Automattic has always been intertwined with) appeared as iconoclasts because they came out saying that founders were the best ones to grow a company long-term and structuring their entire practice and way of investing around that idea.

Unlike my struggles with the <a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/review-of-wp-elasticsearch-plugin\">ElasticSearch Plugin</a>, the folks over at Swiftype couldn&#8217;t have made it any easier to get their plugin up and running.</p>\n<p>After signing up, I viewed their demo video which does a great job of explaining how to install and configure their WordPress plugin.</p>\n<div class=\"aligncenter\"></div>\n<p>Their <a href=\"https://swiftype.com/pricing\">plans</a> range from Hobbyist at $19.00 per month to a Custom Enterprise solution. They don&#8217;t list what comes with the free account but you can find out that information after you sign up. The free account is perfect for small websites that have less than 2,000 articles. As I&#8217;ve learned in this process of reviewing search services, an article, post, orÂ  page is called a document.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One search engine, 2 domains, 2,000 documents, and 50 query customizations. Recrawl once a week. Your search results must display Swiftype branding.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Swiftype doesn&#8217;t enable users to search by categories or dates. However, I&#8217;m beginning to think that if the search results are relevant enough, there isn&#8217;t a need to include those search queries. One of the cool things about Swiftype is that they give you access to manipulate the search results so that if they are not relevant enough, you can take a result and place it higher on the list.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7089\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ManipulateSearchResults.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7089\" alt=\"Manipulate Search Results\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ManipulateSearchResults.jpg?resize=539%2C257\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I can help make the results more relevant</p></div>\n<p>One of my favorite features is the drop-down suggested search results. In my experimental use, I&#8217;ve noticed that most of the time, the results of what I&#8217;m searching for end up in the suggested results drop down box.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SuggestedSearches.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7090\" alt=\"Suggest Searches\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SuggestedSearches.jpg?resize=240%2C278\" /></a></p>\n<p>There are a few instances where the result I&#8217;m looking for is nowhere to be found. For example, if I search for <strong>WPWeekly Episode 10</strong> I see most of the episodes in the 100-110 range when I&#8217;m really looking for episode 10. When disabling the plugin, the search results are roughly equal. Both end up not returning the WPWeekly Episode 10 post as the first result. Using the search built into WordPress, I end up having to browse to the last page of search results to find the post I was looking for. With Swiftype, there is a huge improvement as the post shows up as the 13th result. It&#8217;s not number 1 but it&#8217;s not the last page of results either.</p>\n<p>If I wanted to, I could navigate to the Swiftype dashboard and manually move the results around so that episode 10 <strong>IS</strong> the first result. But, what I don&#8217;t understand is why episode 100-110 were displaying if my search string only contained two numbers? I love the ability to rearrange results but if I have to spend a lot of my time rearranging things, then Swiftype is not doing its job.</p>\n<p>There is one last small issue I had. For some reason, the drop down suggestion box didn&#8217;t work for every search query. For example, if I searched for the term <strong>jeopardy</strong> which I already know exist within the post content of an article, the suggestion box doesn&#8217;t show up but the article that contained the word jeopardy within the content ends up being the first result. I reached out to Swiftype to see if they could explain this behaviour to me and this is what they had to say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Autocomplete suggestions are based on the post title, author name, and tags. Longer text fields like the post body and excerpt are used for full-text searches only (i.e., when the user submits a search). We have implemented it this way because the large volume of text in posts would make the autocomplete results less useful.</p>\n<p>You can read more about the fields we index in this tutorial: <a href=\"https://swiftype.com/documentation/tutorials/customizing_wordpress_search\">https://swiftype.com/documentation/tutorials/customizing_wordpress_search</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Makes sense to me. I also discovered that I misspelled jeopardy when I added it as a tag to the post. Once I fixed the tag, everything worked as it should.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n<p>Swiftype was a breeze to set up and within 10 minutes, I was able to improve the search results on my site.

Unlike my struggles with the <a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/review-of-wp-elasticsearch-plugin\">ElasticSearch Plugin</a>, the folks over at Swiftype couldn&#8217;t have made it any easier to get their plugin up and running.</p>\n<p>After signing up, I viewed their demo video which does a great job of explaining how to install and configure their WordPress plugin.</p>\n<div class=\"aligncenter\"></div>\n<p>Their <a href=\"https://swiftype.com/pricing\">plans</a> range from Hobbyist at $19.00 per month to a Custom Enterprise solution. They don&#8217;t list what comes with the free account but you can find out that information after you sign up. The free account is perfect for small websites that have less than 2,000 articles. As I&#8217;ve learned in this process of reviewing search services, an article, post, orÂ  page is called a document.</p>\n<blockquote><p>One search engine, 2 domains, 2,000 documents, and 50 query customizations. Recrawl once a week. Your search results must display Swiftype branding.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Swiftype doesn&#8217;t enable users to search by categories or dates. However, I&#8217;m beginning to think that if the search results are relevant enough, there isn&#8217;t a need to include those search queries. One of the cool things about Swiftype is that they give you access to manipulate the search results so that if they are not relevant enough, you can take a result and place it higher on the list.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_7089\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ManipulateSearchResults.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-7089\" alt=\"Manipulate Search Results\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ManipulateSearchResults.jpg?resize=539%2C257\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">I can help make the results more relevant</p></div>\n<p>One of my favorite features is the drop-down suggested search results. In my experimental use, I&#8217;ve noticed that most of the time, the results of what I&#8217;m searching for end up in the suggested results drop down box.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SuggestedSearches.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7090\" alt=\"Suggest Searches\" src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SuggestedSearches.jpg?resize=240%2C278\" /></a></p>\n<p>There are a few instances where the result I&#8217;m looking for is nowhere to be found. For example, if I search for <strong>WPWeekly Episode 10</strong> I see most of the episodes in the 100-110 range when I&#8217;m really looking for episode 10. When disabling the plugin, the search results are roughly equal. Both end up not returning the WPWeekly Episode 10 post as the first result. Using the search built into WordPress, I end up having to browse to the last page of search results to find the post I was looking for. With Swiftype, there is a huge improvement as the post shows up as the 13th result. It&#8217;s not number 1 but it&#8217;s not the last page of results either.</p>\n<p>If I wanted to, I could navigate to the Swiftype dashboard and manually move the results around so that episode 10 <strong>IS</strong> the first result. But, what I don&#8217;t understand is why episode 100-110 were displaying if my search string only contained two numbers? I love the ability to rearrange results but if I have to spend a lot of my time rearranging things, then Swiftype is not doing its job.</p>\n<p>There is one last small issue I had. For some reason, the drop down suggestion box didn&#8217;t work for every search query. For example, if I searched for the term <strong>jeopardy</strong> which I already know exist within the post content of an article, the suggestion box doesn&#8217;t show up but the article that contained the word jeopardy within the content ends up being the first result. I reached out to Swiftype to see if they could explain this behaviour to me and this is what they had to say:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Autocomplete suggestions are based on the post title, author name, and tags. Longer text fields like the post body and excerpt are used for full-text searches only (i.e., when the user submits a search). We have implemented it this way because the large volume of text in posts would make the autocomplete results less useful.</p>\n<p>You can read more about the fields we index in this tutorial: <a href=\"https://swiftype.com/documentation/tutorials/customizing_wordpress_search\">https://swiftype.com/documentation/tutorials/customizing_wordpress_search</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>Makes sense to me. I also discovered that I misspelled jeopardy when I added it as a tag to the post. Once I fixed the tag, everything worked as it should.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n<p>Swiftype was a breeze to set up and within 10 minutes, I was able to improve the search results on my site. It only took that long because of the synchronization process. I&#8217;m going to stick with this plugin/service until I find something better but I come away from this experience being able to recommend Swiftype to those who want to substantially improve the built-in search functionality of WordPress. It&#8217;s also encouraging to know that on this journey I&#8217;ve been on, I&#8217;ve discovered that you don&#8217;t have to pay any money to improve the WordPress search.</p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/review-of-wp-elasticsearch-plugin\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Review Of WP-ElasticSearch Plugin\">Review Of WP-ElasticSearch Plugin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/improving-the-wordpress-search-engine-with-relevanssi\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Improving The WordPress Search Engine With Relevanssi\">Improving The WordPress Search Engine With Relevanssi</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/plugin-review-spots-by-interconnectit\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Plugin Review &#8211; Spots By Interconnect/it\">Plugin Review &#8211; Spots By Interconnect/it</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/i4oANGpafnI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";}i:9;a:7:{s:5:\"title\";s:102:\"WordPress.tv: Russell Fair: â€œI Donâ€™t Know Nothinâ€™ â€˜Bout Birthinâ€™ Babiesâ€, er, Child Themes\";s:4:\"guid\";s:28:\"http://wordpress.tv/?p=19169\";s:4:\"link\";s:99:\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/05/23/russell-fair-i-dont-know-nothin-bout-birthin-babies-er-child-themes/\";s:11:\"description\";s:758:\"<div id=\"v-VtACAncc-1\" class=\"video-player\">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/19169/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/19169/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=19169&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/05/23/russell-fair-i-dont-know-nothin-bout-birthin-babies-er-child-themes/\"><img alt=\"Russell Fair: &#8220;I Don&#8217;t Know Nothin&#8217; &#8216;Bout Birthin&#8217; Babies&#8221;, er, Child Themes\" src=\"http://videos.videopress.com/VtACAncc/video-64768b98f3_std.original.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" /></a></div>\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Thu, 23 May 2013 14:56:36 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:12:\"WordPress.tv\";}s:7:\"summary\";s:758:\"<div id=\"v-VtACAncc-1\" class=\"video-player\">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/19169/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/19169/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=19169&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/05/23/russell-fair-i-dont-know-nothin-bout-birthin-babies-er-child-themes/\"><img alt=\"Russell Fair: &#8220;I Don&#8217;t Know Nothin&#8217; &#8216;Bout Birthin&#8217; Babies&#8221;, er, Child Themes\" src=\"http://videos.videopress.com/VtACAncc/video-64768b98f3_std.original.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" /></a></div>\";}i:10;a:7:{s:5:\"title\";s:29:\"WPTavern: WordPress Nostalgia\";s:4:\"guid\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=7079\";s:4:\"link\";s:81:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/umlgyjF8rs8/wordpress-nostalgia\";s:11:\"description\";s:5412:\"<p>As we inch closer towards the 10 year anniversary of WordPress, I&#8217;ve been browsing through a few different time capsule posts.

For these reasons, I can&#8217;t stress enough how important it is to download from the official repository versus somewhere else. That&#8217;s not to say that plugins hosted elsewhere are not equally or more thoroughly screened, but with WordPress.org, you know what you&#8217;re getting.</p>\n<h2>The Big Picture:</h2>\n<p>With over 25,000 plugins in the repository, it&#8217;s becoming increasingly difficult to wade through them all to find the one that perfectly matches functionality with security, support, and reliability.

Using the factors I&#8217;ve listed is this guide can substantially increase the odds that a plugin will work out of the box with little hassle. WPTavern.com uses about 25-29 plugins and most of them have been in use for over 4 years, with little to no trouble.</p>\n<h2>Advice From Other WordPress Faithful:</h2>\n<p>I reached out to a couple of people in the WordPress community that deal with the plugin repository on a routine basis either for their own interest or because they are in the business of working with clients. Here is their advice.</p>\n<p><strong>Al Davis of <a title=\"WPTeach.com\" href=\"http://WPTeach.com\">WPTeach.com</a></strong> &#8211; Check what version the plugin is compatible to, as this is a great indicator as to whether the plugin is still being actively developed. If you are unsure how the plugin is going to work on your site, browse through the support forums, see what kinds of issues others may be having and see if those issues are being addressed. Finally, have a look at the screenshots and FAQ if they are available and make sure the plugin actually does what you are looking for.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://angiemeekerdesigns.com/\">Angie Meeker</a>, Organizer Of WordCamp Columbus and WordPress Consultant</strong> &#8211; My first piece of advice is to ask yourself (and your trusted WordPress adviser or the WP Support Forums), &#8220;<em>Do I really need a plugin for this?</em>&#8221; Many new users to WP are unfamiliar with some of its simplest built-in functions (ones you don&#8217;t even need to know how to code to use). They go searching for a simple gallery plugin, not knowing there&#8217;s one built into the Media Uploader. They search for a plugin to schedule posts, to password protect pages, or to post by email.</p>\n<p><strong>On finding what you want in the first place:</strong><br />\n<strong>1.</strong> Search with as specific of terms as you can think of. &#8220;<em>Rotating Image Galleries</em>&#8221; is a better search than just &#8220;<em>Image Galleries.</em>&#8221; Of course, this is true with all search.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Google &#8220;<em>what you want to do + plugin + wordpress</em>&#8220;, and look only at search results in the repository (those with wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ in the url). I find that sometimes searching the repository from within is limiting.</p>\n<p><strong>Once you&#8217;ve found one:</strong><br />\n<strong>1.</strong> Read the entire description, Installation, FAQ, and Other Notes (<strong>ALL</strong> of them). If there are Screenshots, look at them to get a hint of what the plugin does. Not all plugins have all of these areas completed, though.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Look at the &#8220;<em>Requires Version X.X</em>&#8221; and <em>Compatible to X.X</em>&#8221; If your installation is WordPress 3.1, and the plugin requires 3.5, then it&#8217;s <strong>NOT</strong> the plugin author&#8217;s fault when you install it and it doesn&#8217;t work. Either upgrade your WP install, or don&#8217;t use the plugin. If you&#8217;re using 3.5 but the plugin says it&#8217;s only compatible to 3.1, then there&#8217;s no guarantee it will work with that forward version. It <strong>MIGHT</strong>, but there&#8217;s no guarantee.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, a plugin author knows for <strong>CERTAIN</strong> a plugin <strong>DOESN&#8217;T</strong> work with a newer version, and they&#8217;ll make a note of it in the description. Remember, the authors of these plugins are not paid to create and update these, so if a plugin is not up-to-date, don&#8217;t go berserk on the plugin author. Be polite and ask if/when there might be an update.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Perhaps one of the most useful things you can check out: the Support Forums for a plugin. Plugin authors don&#8217;t <strong>HAVE</strong> to give support for plugins in the repository, but many do. Look at the support threads submitted. How many people submitted the same questions? Does it seem like those questions are simply user error (like maybe they didn&#8217;t read the instructions?) or are they asking about a bug or a problem with the plugin? If there are bugs, is the author responsive to correcting them or providing hints at how users can make corrections? Does the author respond to questions? In my opinion, these point to a plugin author who is vested in the success of his/her plugin, and that usually equals success for you when using it.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> Reviews: These are a recent addition to the WP Plugin Repository, so don&#8217;t be surprised if many plugins don&#8217;t have many or any.</p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> Lastly, clicking on the plugin author&#8217;s name will take you to a list of all the plugins that author has submitted to the repo. It stands to reason that a plugin author whose overall portfolio has quality ratings, good reviews, maintains the support forums for his/her plugins and keeps the plugins up-to-date probably creates plugins the community can trust.</p>\n<p><strong>Marcus Couch co-host of the <a href=\"http://wppluginsatoz.com/\">WordPress Plugins A-Z Podcast</a> also has some bullet points worth checking</strong></p>\n<p><b>1) How long has the plugin been around? What is the update cycle?</b><br />\nNothing is worse than committing to a particular plugin and having the developer drop support after just a few version revisions. An active developer assures you that the plugin will receive update attention throughout the various WordPress Core updates that come along several times a year. A developer that frequently updates along with WordPress versions is a quality to look for when choosing between plugins to install on your live sites.<br />\n<b><br />\n2) Does this plugin play well with the rest of my plugins?</b><br />\nIf you&#8217;ve ever owned an aquarium, you know that some fish don&#8217;t play well with others, often leading to complete breakdown of the natural order and balance of the tank. Plugins are the same way! Make sure that the plugin you are going to install does not &#8220;overlap&#8221; functionality and cause issues in the performance of others.</p>\n<p><b>3) Plugin vs Plugin Race</b><br />\nIf two plugins exist that perform essentially the same function, install them both but activate only one. Run a site load comparison with sites like Pingdom.com and other data load measurement tools. Find out which plugin is more efficient with loading time and use the results to make a determination if one of the plugins takes too long to load or drains too much system memory.</p>\n<p><b>4) Shortcode Dependency</b><br />\nWhen deciding to use a plugin that relies on shortcodes, understand that somewhere down the line you might want to remove that plugin. This means that there could potentially be thousands of instances of [shortcode] throughout your page and post content.</p>\n<p><b>5) Community</b><br />\nIs there a great community behind the plugin? There are so few plugins with thriving, rabid communities, but it&#8217;s always a huge bonus when a large base of plugin fans can gather with the developer and help to improve a plugin and it&#8217;s core functionality. Once you start using a plugin on a regular basis and find that there is an active community associated with it, PARTICIPATE! I&#8217;ve had many plugins programmed with exactly the functions that I needed simply because I asked the developer to include them in future revisions.</p>\n<h2>Summary:</h2>\n<p>I realize that some of the information in this post is redundant but Angie provides real-world expectations and views. <a href=\"http://coffee2code.com/\">Scott Reilly</a> clearly sums everything up into one paragraph.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When choosing an appropriate plugin from the Plugins Directory it&#8217;s often best to take various factors into consideration rather than just any single factor. The plugin author, the number of support threads replied to in the past two months, the nature of the types of support threads being created (and the nature of the author&#8217;s responses, if any), the number and nature of the reviews being given (or lack thereof), the last update date, and the rating can all play a factor in making a decision.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you can contribute anything else to this guide for choosing which plugins to install, please do so in the comments.</p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/improving-the-wordpress-search-engine-with-relevanssi\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Improving The WordPress Search Engine With Relevanssi\">Improving The WordPress Search Engine With Relevanssi</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/60XdX6380Vo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Tue, 21 May 2013 18:44:06 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";}s:7:\"summary\";s:14673:\"<p>One of the best things about WordPress is its third-party ecosystem of themes and plugins.

Finally, have a look at the screenshots and FAQ if they are available and make sure the plugin actually does what you are looking for.</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://angiemeekerdesigns.com/\">Angie Meeker</a>, Organizer Of WordCamp Columbus and WordPress Consultant</strong> &#8211; My first piece of advice is to ask yourself (and your trusted WordPress adviser or the WP Support Forums), &#8220;<em>Do I really need a plugin for this?</em>&#8221; Many new users to WP are unfamiliar with some of its simplest built-in functions (ones you don&#8217;t even need to know how to code to use). They go searching for a simple gallery plugin, not knowing there&#8217;s one built into the Media Uploader. They search for a plugin to schedule posts, to password protect pages, or to post by email.</p>\n<p><strong>On finding what you want in the first place:</strong><br />\n<strong>1.</strong> Search with as specific of terms as you can think of. &#8220;<em>Rotating Image Galleries</em>&#8221; is a better search than just &#8220;<em>Image Galleries.</em>&#8221; Of course, this is true with all search.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Google &#8220;<em>what you want to do + plugin + wordpress</em>&#8220;, and look only at search results in the repository (those with wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ in the url). I find that sometimes searching the repository from within is limiting.</p>\n<p><strong>Once you&#8217;ve found one:</strong><br />\n<strong>1.</strong> Read the entire description, Installation, FAQ, and Other Notes (<strong>ALL</strong> of them). If there are Screenshots, look at them to get a hint of what the plugin does. Not all plugins have all of these areas completed, though.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> Look at the &#8220;<em>Requires Version X.X</em>&#8221; and <em>Compatible to X.X</em>&#8221; If your installation is WordPress 3.1, and the plugin requires 3.5, then it&#8217;s <strong>NOT</strong> the plugin author&#8217;s fault when you install it and it doesn&#8217;t work. Either upgrade your WP install, or don&#8217;t use the plugin. If you&#8217;re using 3.5 but the plugin says it&#8217;s only compatible to 3.1, then there&#8217;s no guarantee it will work with that forward version. It <strong>MIGHT</strong>, but there&#8217;s no guarantee.</p>\n<p>Sometimes, a plugin author knows for <strong>CERTAIN</strong> a plugin <strong>DOESN&#8217;T</strong> work with a newer version, and they&#8217;ll make a note of it in the description. Remember, the authors of these plugins are not paid to create and update these, so if a plugin is not up-to-date, don&#8217;t go berserk on the plugin author. Be polite and ask if/when there might be an update.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Perhaps one of the most useful things you can check out: the Support Forums for a plugin. Plugin authors don&#8217;t <strong>HAVE</strong> to give support for plugins in the repository, but many do. Look at the support threads submitted. How many people submitted the same questions? Does it seem like those questions are simply user error (like maybe they didn&#8217;t read the instructions?) or are they asking about a bug or a problem with the plugin? If there are bugs, is the author responsive to correcting them or providing hints at how users can make corrections? Does the author respond to questions? In my opinion, these point to a plugin author who is vested in the success of his/her plugin, and that usually equals success for you when using it.</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> Reviews: These are a recent addition to the WP Plugin Repository, so don&#8217;t be surprised if many plugins don&#8217;t have many or any.</p>\n<p><strong>5.</strong> Lastly, clicking on the plugin author&#8217;s name will take you to a list of all the plugins that author has submitted to the repo. It stands to reason that a plugin author whose overall portfolio has quality ratings, good reviews, maintains the support forums for his/her plugins and keeps the plugins up-to-date probably creates plugins the community can trust.</p>\n<p><strong>Marcus Couch co-host of the <a href=\"http://wppluginsatoz.com/\">WordPress Plugins A-Z Podcast</a> also has some bullet points worth checking</strong></p>\n<p><b>1) How long has the plugin been around? What is the update cycle?</b><br />\nNothing is worse than committing to a particular plugin and having the developer drop support after just a few version revisions. An active developer assures you that the plugin will receive update attention throughout the various WordPress Core updates that come along several times a year. A developer that frequently updates along with WordPress versions is a quality to look for when choosing between plugins to install on your live sites.<br />\n<b><br />\n2) Does this plugin play well with the rest of my plugins?</b><br />\nIf you&#8217;ve ever owned an aquarium, you know that some fish don&#8217;t play well with others, often leading to complete breakdown of the natural order and balance of the tank. Plugins are the same way! Make sure that the plugin you are going to install does not &#8220;overlap&#8221; functionality and cause issues in the performance of others.</p>\n<p><b>3) Plugin vs Plugin Race</b><br />\nIf two plugins exist that perform essentially the same function, install them both but activate only one. Run a site load comparison with sites like Pingdom.com and other data load measurement tools. Find out which plugin is more efficient with loading time and use the results to make a determination if one of the plugins takes too long to load or drains too much system memory.</p>\n<p><b>4) Shortcode Dependency</b><br />\nWhen deciding to use a plugin that relies on shortcodes, understand that somewhere down the line you might want to remove that plugin. This means that there could potentially be thousands of instances of [shortcode] throughout your page and post content.</p>\n<p><b>5) Community</b><br />\nIs there a great community behind the plugin? There are so few plugins with thriving, rabid communities, but it&#8217;s always a huge bonus when a large base of plugin fans can gather with the developer and help to improve a plugin and it&#8217;s core functionality. Once you start using a plugin on a regular basis and find that there is an active community associated with it, PARTICIPATE! I&#8217;ve had many plugins programmed with exactly the functions that I needed simply because I asked the developer to include them in future revisions.</p>\n<h2>Summary:</h2>\n<p>I realize that some of the information in this post is redundant but Angie provides real-world expectations and views. <a href=\"http://coffee2code.com/\">Scott Reilly</a> clearly sums everything up into one paragraph.</p>\n<blockquote><p>When choosing an appropriate plugin from the Plugins Directory it&#8217;s often best to take various factors into consideration rather than just any single factor. The plugin author, the number of support threads replied to in the past two months, the nature of the types of support threads being created (and the nature of the author&#8217;s responses, if any), the number and nature of the reviews being given (or lack thereof), the last update date, and the rating can all play a factor in making a decision.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you can contribute anything else to this guide for choosing which plugins to install, please do so in the comments.</p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a

They call it, <a href=\"http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/05/15/conditional-widget-visibility/\">Widget Visibility</a>. Users can either hide or show widgets based on <strong>category, author, tag, date, or page</strong>. This covers the most common use cases without having a need to use conditional tags. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WidgetVisibility.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WidgetVisibility.jpg?resize=399%2C189\" alt=\"Widget Visibility \" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7009\" /></a></p>\n<p>The interface is surprisingly simple. In fact, I prefer what WordPress.com is using versus Widget Logic which requires me to know conditional tags. I&#8217;m wondering how did WordPress.com get this feature before stand-alone WordPress?

They call it, <a href=\"http://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/05/15/conditional-widget-visibility/\">Widget Visibility</a>. Users can either hide or show widgets based on <strong>category, author, tag, date, or page</strong>. This covers the most common use cases without having a need to use conditional tags. </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WidgetVisibility.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WidgetVisibility.jpg?resize=399%2C189\" alt=\"Widget Visibility \" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-7009\" /></a></p>\n<p>The interface is surprisingly simple.

This new UI exposes the Post Format functionality that is now relegated to a radio button post meta box. While researching this feature, I came across a <a href=\"http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/04/23/post-formats-schedules-and-philosophy/\">discussion on the Make.WordPress.org</a> site where it almost didn&#8217;t make it. If you use Post Formats now, the new UI is actually much nicer to use than the simple radio selection box. With each Post Format, the Post Screen changes to accommodate specific items. For example, when the Quote format is chosen, a quote source and quote link area is displayed above the post title. However, if you don&#8217;t use Post Formats, this new UI becomes yet another distraction into your publishing routine. Thankfully, the standard format is selected by default which is just a normal post.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_6994\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/PostFormatsUI.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-6994\" alt=\"Post Formats UI\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/PostFormatsUI.jpg?resize=515%2C137\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Post Formats UI In WordPress 3.6 Beta 3</p></div>\n<p>If you would like to hide the new UI from showing up, there is an option within the screen options drop down tab where you can un-check the Post Formats box.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/HidePostFormats.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6997\" alt=\"Hide Post Formats\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/HidePostFormats.jpg?resize=352%2C162\" /></a>This only hides the UI from an individual.&nbsp; For multi-author sites, you&#8217;ll need to install a plugin such as the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/disable-post-format-ui/\">one Justin Tadlock created</a>. If you&#8217;re curious to see an idea of a post format UI before WordPress 3.6, read <a href=\"http://alexking.org/blog/2011/10/25/wordpress-post-formats-admin-ui\">Alex Kings post on a plugin he released </a>called Post Formats Admin UI.</p>\n<h2>Where Did Post Formats Come From And What Are They?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats\">Post formats</a> is a feature introduced in WordPress 3.1 as a way for themes to visually differentiate between types of content. Before the addition of post formats, users had to rely on CSS tricks to create specific styles for different kinds of content. A great example, is <a href=\"http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2007/09/06/using-wordpress-categories-to-style-posts/\">this post written by Lorelle Van Fossen</a> from 2007 that explains how to use WordPress Categories combined with assigned CSS classes to style posts. Coincidentally, <a href=\"http://davidville.wordpress.com/2007/02/19/tumblr/\">Tumblr launched in February 2007</a> and introduced a beautiful new way to publish content. This <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/244915/geek-to-live--instant-no+overhead-blog-with-tumblr\">review by LifeHacker</a> shows the layout for creating different types of content. I was part of the mob that hopped onto the Tumblr bandwagon coming away from that experience very impressed with how easy it was to publish content. I didn&#8217;t have to worry about tags, categories or any of that meta stuff. It was simply pick a type of content, provide content, publish. What a joy that was. The best feature of Tumblr was their bookmarklet. This bookmarklet I feel is one of the biggest reasons for Tumblrs success.</p>\n<p>WordPress on the other hand has this bookmarklet called PressThis. It works in a similar fashion to the Tumblr bookmarklet but because of the publishing process on WordPress, it was never as elegant or convenient to use. Using PressThis, you have to select a category for the post, usually have to edit the title and most of the time had to edit the link text not to mention the addition of tags. In May of 2010, <a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/matt-talks-ning-foundation-and-pressthis\">Mashable conducted an interview</a> with Matt where one of the topics discussed was the PressThis bookmarklet. Around the 2:06 mark in that interview, Matt says that Tumblr did a beautiful job of removing that little bit of friction to publishing content which he hoped would be similarly achieved with PressThis.</p>\n<p>Once post formats reached the masses with WordPress 3.1, the general community had the task of explaining what post formats were and to this day, it&#8217;s still a struggle without being able to visually show someone. People were so confused with the terminology, <a href=\"http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2010/11/12/post-formats-vs-custom-post-types/\">Mark Jaquith</a> and <a href=\"http://ottopress.com/2010/post-types-and-formats-and-taxonomies-oh-my/\">Otto</a> both published posts with explanations. At the time, I thought <a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-to-be-more-tumblr-like\">post formats would be awesome</a> because of the Tumblr like inspiration but as users, we had to rely on Themes for how the formats were used and displayed.</p>\n<h2>My Thoughts On Post Formats</h2>\n<p>I used post formats for a few months on WPTavern.com and I&#8217;ve made a few conclusions. The first is that post formats encourage short form content. Not only is short form content easy to do, it also promotes creating a fire hose of content. The second, the majority of people were reading WPTavern.com via their favorite feedreader. Feedreaders don&#8217;t display content the same as a website. Third, some of the formats I selected displayed on the home page without a post title or an ability to comment. I think this had more to do with how my theme was displaying the formats more than anything else. Last but not least, I started treating post formats as categories.</p>\n<p>Some of my frustrations with post formats came at the cost of not fully understanding the when and why of the feature. I&#8217;ve also discovered that depending upon how the formats are displayed, it&#8217;s very difficult to determine what&#8217;s content and what&#8217;s something else. I&#8217;m so used to seeing the <em>Post Title, content, post meta</em> layout on websites that when I see a posts that are quotes with little text, it sometimes becomes difficult to navigate. A good example of this is the <a href=\"http://twentythirteendemo.wordpress.com/\">2013 Theme</a>. </p>\n<p>I no longer use post formats. Instead, I just write a normal (<em>standard</em>) blog post containing a quote, video, image or anything else I want. Creating different styles for different types of content was cool but now, it&#8217;s not a big deal anymore. I&#8217;d rather see a consistent style for the content I consume and create versus wildly different layouts, colors, and expectations.</p>\n<h2>Discussion Points</h2>\n<p>I want to hear from developers and consultants on how they teach post formats to clients. How do you make the distinction between the different kinds of posts that can be created? What do you think of the revamped UI for post formats in WordPress 3.6, will it get more people to use this feature?</p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-to-be-more-tumblr-like\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"WordPress To Be More Tumblr Like\">WordPress To Be More Tumblr Like</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/are-we-afraid-to-do-what-we-want-with-our-blogs\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Are We Afraid To Do What We Want With Our Blogs?\">Are We Afraid To Do What We Want With Our Blogs?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/alex-king-releases-post-formats-admin-ui-code\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Alex King Releases Post Formats Admin UI Code\">Alex King Releases Post Formats Admin UI Code</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/0ADtNk03XHY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Thu, 16 May 2013 17:50:11 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";}s:7:\"summary\";s:8115:\"<p>While WordPress 3.6 is almost ready for release, one of the features that is already generating a love/hate relationship is the new Post Formats UI.

The details are at <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/WordPress/Salt-Lake-City-UT/930892/\">http://www.meetup.com/WordPress/Salt-Lake-City-UT/930892/</a>:</p>\n<p><strong>When:</strong> Monday, May 27, 2013, 7:00 PM<br />\n<strong>Where:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.sonnybryans.com/\">Sonny Brian&#8217;s</a>; 33 East 11400 South in Sandy</p>\n<p><br /><small><a href=\"https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=33+E+11400+S,+Sandy,+UT&ie=UTF8&ll=40.54435,-111.890603&spn=0.006295,0.008284&t=m&source=embed\">View Larger Map</a></small></p>\n<p>If you are coming be sure to <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/WordPress/Salt-Lake-City-UT/930892/\">RSVP</a> so that we have an idea of how many people to expect.  Bluehost is also giving away the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/04/wordpress-10th-anniversary-tees/\">10th Anniversary WordPress t-shirts</a> to the first 30 people who fill out <a href=\"http://wpslc.com/blog/2013/05/13/may-27th-meetup-wordpress-10th-anniversary/\">this form on wpslc.com</a>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2013/04/wp10shirtgrayblack.jpg?resize=584%2C302\" class=\"aligncenter\" /></p>\n<p>It will be a fun time to hang out and chat with other local WordPress fans/users/designers/developers.</p>\";}i:34;a:7:{s:5:\"title\";s:43:\"WPTavern: Review Of WP-ElasticSearch Plugin\";s:4:\"guid\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=6980\";s:4:\"link\";s:95:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/1do2CNarE8M/review-of-wp-elasticsearch-plugin\";s:11:\"description\";s:5651:\"<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SearchBoxIOLogo.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-6981\" alt=\"SearchBoxIO Logo\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SearchBoxIOLogo.jpg?resize=193%2C37\" /></a>On my recent article <a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/searching-for-a-better-wordpress-search\">discussing the search functionality</a> within WordPress, a few folks in the comments suggested alternatives to try. One of those was the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-elasticsearch/\">ElasticSearch</a> plugin. My main complaint in that article was that there was not an easy way to tap into the Elastic Search service without having access to a dedicated server or VPS. This is where SearchBox.IO comes in handy. <a href=\"https://searchbox.io/\">SearchBox.IO</a> is a cloud based search platform powered by the Elastic Search technology. While there is no mention of a WordPress plugin on their site, one does exist.</p>\n<p>Installing the plugin from the repository was easy, once I found it. After installation, you&#8217;ll need to connect the plugin to the Searchbox API server. On the configuration screen, it&#8217;s not obvious as to where you would get the API key. However, the <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-elasticsearch/installation/\">installation instructions</a> on the WordPress.org plugin page tell you where to go. Once you sign up for a free account, you&#8217;ll need to copy and paste the <strong>Connection URL:</strong> provided into the <strong>Elastic Server url</strong> box.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ElasticSearchConfig.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6982\" alt=\"Elastic Search Configuration\" src=\"http://i0.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ElasticSearchConfig.jpg?resize=500%2C258\" /></a></p>\n<p>Once a connection is established, you&#8217;ll see a green server status indicator. The next step is indexing posts. Before you click the Index button, you&#8217;ll need to make sure that the <strong>Default Post Index Name</strong> within the <strong>Indexing Configurations</strong> matches the index name on your Searchbox.IO account. By default, it&#8217;s <strong>WordPress</strong> but I changed mine to WPTavern. It&#8217;s worth noting that the free account only allows <em>one Index, 3,000 documents, 10 MB of storage and something called a sleepy index</em>. After the site is indexed, you&#8217;ll want to visit the widgets section and place the Elasticsearch Facet Widget at the top of the sidebar. It will only be displayed when someone searches your site.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ElasticSearchWidget.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-6983\" alt=\"ElasticSearchWidget\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/ElasticSearchWidget.jpg?resize=306%2C361\" /></a></p>\n<p>The widget adds the ability to narrow down a search via <strong>Tags</strong>, <strong>Categories</strong>, or <strong>Author</strong>. At this point, it&#8217;s difficult to tell when your site is using Searchbox.IO for the search query or if it&#8217;s using the local database. I have not found an easy way of figuring this out. I did send in a support query asking for some clarification, here was the response:</p>\n<p><strong>Q: I&#8217;ve installed and configured the WP-Elastic search plugin. However, I am having a hard time figuring out when searches are offloaded to the Searchbox.io service versus when my local database is polled. Could you please clarify this for me?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>A: Plugin simply searches at searchbox and executes get requests to mysql with returned ids. Hope it is clear, let me know if you have more questions.</strong></p>\n<p>I have no idea what that means so if you do, please tell me in the comments.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion:</h2>\n<p>After everything was said and done, I couldn&#8217;t tell whether the searches I performed were any more relevant than the default search in WordPress. However, this plugin tied into Searchbox.IO does add the features I&#8217;m looking for in a more advanced WordPress search. One thing I really didn&#8217;t like is that each time a check box is selected for a tag, category, or author, it generated another search query. This doesn&#8217;t make any sense to me. I&#8217;d much rather see an implementation where I can configure those parameters then click on a search button or hit enter. This plugin along with the Searchbox.IO website could use more polish. It would be nice to see an entire page on their website dedicated to WordPress that explains what the plugin does, how to set it up and ultimately, how to know if it&#8217;s working.</p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/review-of-the-limit-login-attempts-plugin\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Review Of The Limit Login Attempts Plugin\">Review Of The Limit Login Attempts Plugin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/improving-the-wordpress-search-engine-with-relevanssi\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Improving The WordPress Search Engine With Relevanssi\">Improving The WordPress Search Engine With Relevanssi</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/plugin-review-spots-by-interconnectit\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Plugin Review &#8211; Spots By Interconnect/it\">Plugin Review &#8211; Spots By Interconnect/it</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/1do2CNarE8M\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Wed, 15 May 2013 20:51:47 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";}s:7:\"summary\";s:5651:\"<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SearchBoxIOLogo.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-6981\" alt=\"SearchBoxIO Logo\" src=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/SearchBoxIOLogo.jpg?resize=193%2C37\" /></a>On my recent article <a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/searching-for-a-better-wordpress-search\">discussing the search functionality</a> within WordPress, a few folks in the comments suggested alternatives to try.

I&#8217;m sure John is under a huge amount of pressure to deliver considering the amount of funding he will end up receiving. </p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-com-reaches-60-million-blogs-milestone\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"WordPress.com Reaches 60 Million Blogs Milestone\">WordPress.com Reaches 60 Million Blogs Milestone</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/YnKzMy1keWM\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";}i:37;a:7:{s:5:\"title\";s:43:\"WPTavern: 10 Year Anniversary Project Entry\";s:4:\"guid\";s:31:\"http://www.wptavern.com/?p=6963\";s:4:\"link\";s:95:\"http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~3/sBstWSa-9SA/10-year-anniversary-project-entry\";s:11:\"description\";s:3846:\"<p><a href=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/10thAnniversary.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i2.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/10thAnniversary.jpg?resize=150%2C150\" alt=\"WordPress 10th Anniversary\" class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-6967\" /></a>May 27th, 2013 marks the 10 year anniversary of the release of WordPress.

That goal is changing the content direction of the site so that it&#8217;s not created by one person, all the time. There are so many smart WordPress people throughout the overall community and I would like to personally extend an invitation to share your knowledge here on WPTavern.com. Whether it&#8217;s bbPress, BuddyPress, GlotPress, a theme review, plugin review, or an interesting set of questions you would like to pose to the WordPress community, please consider WPTavern as an avenue for publishing. I&#8217;ll give you a few reasons why. </p>\n<p>The first is that WPTavern has a world-wide audience. Having articles linked within the Dashboard is not only a big responsibility, but it has opened the flood gates to the different types of people accessing the content presented on this site from across the world. Through referrer links, I&#8217;ve been able to discover so many different websites thanks to people clinking the links from within their dashboard. WPTavern.com is like a giant megaphone that when used correctly, becomes a wonderful thing. </p>\n<p>In the near future, WPTavern will become an authoritative website. It&#8217;s not about publishing 100 articles a day, but publishing content that is interesting and, providing research/back story to that content. I like to think of WPTavern as an ongoing diary as to what is happening within the world of WordPress. However I&#8217;m opening up this diary/platform to the community. There will be caveats of course such as all content passes before me before it&#8217;s published. Guest authors will receive a Contributor level account to make things easier for the author to manage their posts. </p>\n<p>If you look around, you&#8217;ll notice that there are no ads on this site. WPTavern.com is not about generating revenue. It&#8217;s about becoming the second largest WordPress community of users and enthusiasts on the web. Of course, the first is WordPress.org itself but the long-term goal for this site is to become an alternative community with an integral bridge to the WordPress project. WordPress.org is not right for everyone whether it be the attitude of people, the atmosphere, or any number of reasons which is why having another place to go is beneficial. In the early days of WPTavern, this website was on pace to become one of the largest parts of the WordPress community with a bustling commenting section, an active forum, and all sorts of different interactions taking place that at times, influenced some of the decisions that were made with the core of WordPress. </p>\n<p>There were plenty of times in the past where members of the WPTavern community tried to nominate me to become some sort of WordPress.org community liaison or an employee of Automattic. With the relaunch of WPTavern, I am now in the position at least with this domain to become that community liaison. In the near future, this site will be sporting a new design, bbPress and finally, run BuddyPress. A tavern is a place where people gather to talk and have a good time which is exactly the kind of atmosphere I&#8217;ll be promoting here.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in contributing an article to this site, please get in touch with me via the contact form or through twitter @WPTavern.</p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wptavern-watering-hole-still-open-for-business\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"WPTavern Watering Hole Still Open For Business\">WPTavern Watering Hole Still Open For Business</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/welcome-to-the-wordpress-tavern\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Welcome To The WordPress Tavern\">Welcome To The WordPress Tavern</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-org-should-scare-you\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"WordPress.org Should Scare You\">WordPress.org Should Scare You</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/3_--Ndj2CdU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 May 2013 20:14:48 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";}s:7:\"summary\";s:4378:\"<p><a href=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WPWorldLogo.jpg\" rel=\"thumbnail\"><img src=\"http://i1.wp.com/www.wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WPWorldLogo.jpg?resize=200%2C160\" alt=\"WordPress World\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-6948\" /></a>While the Tavern is definitely back in business, there is one specific goal I have in mind that I would like to accomplish.

Of course, the first is WordPress.org itself but the long-term goal for this site is to become an alternative community with an integral bridge to the WordPress project. WordPress.org is not right for everyone whether it be the attitude of people, the atmosphere, or any number of reasons which is why having another place to go is beneficial. In the early days of WPTavern, this website was on pace to become one of the largest parts of the WordPress community with a bustling commenting section, an active forum, and all sorts of different interactions taking place that at times, influenced some of the decisions that were made with the core of WordPress. </p>\n<p>There were plenty of times in the past where members of the WPTavern community tried to nominate me to become some sort of WordPress.org community liaison or an employee of Automattic. With the relaunch of WPTavern, I am now in the position at least with this domain to become that community liaison. In the near future, this site will be sporting a new design, bbPress and finally, run BuddyPress. A tavern is a place where people gather to talk and have a good time which is exactly the kind of atmosphere I&#8217;ll be promoting here.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in contributing an article to this site, please get in touch with me via the contact form or through twitter @WPTavern.</p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wptavern-watering-hole-still-open-for-business\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"WPTavern Watering Hole Still Open For Business\">WPTavern Watering Hole Still Open For Business</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/welcome-to-the-wordpress-tavern\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Welcome To The WordPress Tavern\">Welcome To The WordPress Tavern</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-org-should-scare-you\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"WordPress.org Should Scare You\">WordPress.org Should Scare You</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/3_--Ndj2CdU\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";}i:42;a:7:{s:5:\"title\";s:65:\"Akismet: University Site on WordPress?

I thought it sounded like a cool idea so I got in touch with James Lane, one of the founders behind the site to ask him what it&#8217;s all about. </p>\n<p><strong><em>Q: First off, can you explain what ExperimentWith is?</em></strong></p>\n<p>ExperimentWith.com was started as a testing site for our clients sites while we develop them. It had a nice ring to it and it allowed us to host testing on a separate but not local server. It also allowed for testing in an MU environment. But as we ran into more and more issues with plugins that were never tested on an MU environment so we allowed some authors to test and helped debug a few plugins so we can use them for client projects. After a few projects, we discussed it would be nice to open up our MU based site to who ever wants to use it for testing, debugging or whatever for projects for the community. That was two months ago.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Q: What is going on behind the scenes of ExperimentWith.com and what software or hardware are you using to offer this service?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Behind the scenes its a WordPress MU site running on one of our business class hosting accounts with access to ruby and sass for testing WordPress plugins and themes. Its hosted off our MidPhase account although we have moved most of our site to BlueHost, RackSpace, or ZippyKid. We purchased five years of hosting from MidPhase and said what the hell, lets make it useful and if it becomes popular then we can keep it running.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Q: Is ExperimentWith exclusively tailored for WordPress testing?</em></strong></p>\n<p>We are tailored for WordPress testing but our server has elements running on it to allow for other WordPress integrations like Ruby, SASS, node.js, ect. We like experimenting with other projects out there to see how they can improve, on client specific projects.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Q: It looks like the site is not yet open to the public, do you have a firm date in mind as to when that will happen?</em></strong></p>\n<p>As for going public, we decided to initially start it up as an email us for about your project and if we like it and it won&#8217;t cause the end of the world or WordPress as we know it we will give you access. We never thought that more than a few people may take interest in it or would need the resources. So not to dance around your question but Experiment With is a very dynamic project and we are open to help develop it to whatever the community needs.</p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/wordpress-2-8-1-beta-by-end-of-the-week\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"WordPress 2.8.1 Beta By End Of The Week\">WordPress 2.8.1 Beta By End Of The Week</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/tbItUVd3scc\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 May 2013 15:27:32 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:6:\"Jeffro\";}s:7:\"summary\";s:3032:\"<p><a href=\"http://www.ExperimentWith.com\">ExperimentWith.com</a> is an idea that&#8217;s still at the seedling stage but has the possibilities of being built into a testing platform for various projects.

Would you like to see what&#8217;s presented within MP6 to be the next design iteration of the WordPress back-end or are you content with the current grey-blue color scheme?</p>\n<div class=\"yarpp-related-rss\">\n<p>Related posts:<ol>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/the-header-wont-be-changing-in-28\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"The Header Won&#8217;t Be Changing In 2.8\">The Header Won&#8217;t Be Changing In 2.8</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/vote-for-the-new-header-design\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Vote For The New Header Design\">Vote For The New Header Design</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.wptavern.com/basic-guide-on-creating-plugin-ui\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Basic Guide On Creating Plugin UI\">Basic Guide On Creating Plugin UI</a></li>\n</ol></p>\n</div>\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/WordpressTavern/~4/qPSAnt3ynuw\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" />\";}i:45;a:7:{s:5:\"title\";s:85:\"WordPress.tv: Luca Mascaro: UX mix â€“ come creare unâ€™esperienza dâ€™uso eccellente\";s:4:\"guid\";s:28:\"http://wordpress.tv/?p=17339\";s:4:\"link\";s:92:\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/05/12/luca-mascaro-ux-mix-come-creare-unesperienza-duso-eccellente/\";s:11:\"description\";s:720:\"<div id=\"v-d9OF9nvK-1\" class=\"video-player\">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/17339/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/17339/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=17339&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/05/12/luca-mascaro-ux-mix-come-creare-unesperienza-duso-eccellente/\"><img alt=\"Luca Mascaro: UX mix &#8211; come creare unâ€™esperienza dâ€™uso eccellente\" src=\"http://videos.videopress.com/d9OF9nvK/video-1f9f3371d8_scruberthumbnail_1.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" /></a></div>\";s:7:\"pubdate\";s:31:\"Sun, 12 May 2013 14:48:54 +0000\";s:2:\"dc\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";s:12:\"WordPress.tv\";}s:7:\"summary\";s:720:\"<div id=\"v-d9OF9nvK-1\" class=\"video-player\">\n</div>\n<br />  <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/wptv.wordpress.com/17339/\"><img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/wptv.wordpress.com/17339/\" /></a> <img alt=\"\" border=\"0\" src=\"http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=wordpress.tv&blog=5089392&post=17339&subd=wptv&ref=&feed=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" /><div><a href=\"http://wordpress.tv/2013/05/12/luca-mascaro-ux-mix-come-creare-unesperienza-duso-eccellente/\"><img alt=\"Luca Mascaro: UX mix &#8211; come creare unâ€™esperienza dâ€™uso eccellente\" src=\"http://videos.videopress.com/d9OF9nvK/video-1f9f3371d8_scruberthumbnail_1.jpg\" width=\"160\" height=\"120\" /></a></div>\";}i:46;a:7:{s:5:\"title\";s:30:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 3.6 Beta 3\";s:4:\"guid\";s:33:\"http://wordpress.org/news/?p=2584\";s:4:\"link\";s:55:\"http://wordpress.org/news/2013/05/wordpress-3-6-beta-3/\";s:11:\"description\";s:2182:\"<p>WordPress 3.6 Beta 3 is now available!</p>\n<p>This is software still in development andÂ <strong>we <em>really</em>Â donâ€™t recommend that you run it on a production site</strong>Â â€” set up a test site just to play with the new version.Â To test WordPress 3.6, try theÂ <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a>Â plugin (youâ€™ll want â€œbleeding edge nightliesâ€).

To the 12,126 of you who have already downloaded WordPress 1.5, congrats for being on the ball. We had a â€œsoft launchâ€ on Monday the 14<sup>th</sup> while we worked out some infrastructure issues and weâ€™re now very ready to announce WordPress 1.5 to the world. This release is named â€œStrayhornâ€ in honor of Billy Strayhorn the pianist and sublime composer who worked closely with Duke Ellington and wrote tunes like â€œTake the A Trainâ€ and â€œLush Life.â€ We thought he was perfect to represent the power and elegance of this release, which has been under intense development and testing the past few months.</p>\r\n<p>If youâ€™re ready to get right to the meat, <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/download/\">go download WordPress</a> and donâ€™t forget to read the <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress\">installation</a> or <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrading_WordPress\">upgrade</a> instructions. If youâ€™d like to know more about the release, please make yourself comfortable and read on, weâ€™ve got a lot to share.</p>\r\n<p>1.5 has been our most user-focused development ever: weâ€™ve listened closely to your requests, complaints, praise, pleas, and weâ€™ve done our best to address these both in the core and through enabling plugin authors more flexibility. Any sentence that started â€œI love WordPress except forâ€¦â€ was fuel for the fire. Here are the key areas we addressed with in Strayhorn:</p>\r\n<p><span id=\"more-151\"></span></p>\r\n<h4>Templates and Site Customization</h4>\r\n<p>In the past the template system was simple to grasp but complicated to extend, especially if you wanted to create different templates for different sections of your site. In 1.5 we have created an <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes\">incredibly flexible theme system</a> that adapts to you rather than expecting you adapt to it. You can have your entire weblog run through a single file, just like before, or you can literally have a different template for every single different category. Itâ€™s as much or as little as you want. Weâ€™ve also broken common site elements like headers, footers, and sidebars into their own files so you can make a change in one place and see it everywhere immediately. As a quick example of how easy the new system is, letâ€™s say that you <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrade_1.2_to_1.5\">ported your old template</a> to a 1.5 theme and then decided that you wanted your permalink pages to work differently than your front page, simply drop a file called <code>single.php</code> into your directory and WordPress will automatically use it instead of the main template when on a permalink page. Thatâ€™s it.</p>\r\n<p>Of course we wanted to showcase the new flexibility with a new theme that took full advantage of it and was aesthetically pleasing to boot, so the new default theme for WordPress is the <a href=\"http://binarybonsai.com/kubrick/\">beautiful Kubrick by Michael Heilemann</a>. For people who want to get their feet wet but not build a theme or design from scratch, Kubrick provides a fantastic foundation that has already <a href=\"http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes#Get_New_Themes\">inspired quite a bit of creativity</a>. You can switch between themes with a single click.</p>\r\n<h4>Control Your Comments</h4>\r\n<p>For many comments are the best part of weblogging, they enable easy and transparent interaction to take place between you the author and your audience. However some unsavory characters have made this open interaction more of a burden than a blessing. WordPress 1.5 aims to bring the joy back to comments. First weâ€™ve made everything much more secure by default using a new option we call â€œemergent registrationâ€ or â€œautomatic whitelisting.â€ What it does is the first time someone comments they are automatically held in moderation unless youâ€™ve approved something from them before. This means that your regular visitors donâ€™t have to wait for you to manually approve each comment they make, thus slowing down the conversation, but you still can ensure that a drive-by comment vandal will never show up on your site. This is enabled by default, so that also means if you forget about your blog for a little while you wonâ€™t come back to find your domain a nest of spam (which begets more spam). This works for trackbacks and pingbacks too, and we even go the extra step of whitelisting domains that are in your blogroll.</p>\r\n<h4>Everything In Moderation</h4>\r\n<p>Many of you let us know that the moderation feature of WordPress was working great in catching your spam, but you still had to deal with spam even though it never got on your site. Well first we streamlined the comment management tools so itâ€™s really easy to deal with hundreds or thousands of comments, trackbacks, and pingbacks at once, but we also added a blacklist option. There has been some really disgusting spam going around, and most of us can be certain that under no circumstances would we want some terms on our website, unlike moderation which is for things that may be risque but may also occur in a normal conversation. When something hits your blacklist you never even have to see it. (Even though we do save it for later analysis.) Weâ€™ve also added code for checking for insecure proxies, which how the large majority of spammers leave comments while hiding their identity, which we now block by default.</p>\r\n<h4>Conversation Registration</h4>\r\n<p>Finally weâ€™ve integrated our user system and comment system much closer. You can now specify that you only want comments from people that have verified their email and registered on your weblog, without any dependencies or having to share any data with third-party external systems. We revamped the registration and login system to make this as seamless and easy as possible. When someone is logged in we also tweak the comment form just for them. You could combine this with something like the plugin that hides posts from lower-level users and have a very well-protected weblog.</p>\r\n<h4>Manage More Than Your Blog</h4>\r\n<p>Another thing we observed and heard was that you wanted to use the elegant WordPress interface to manage more of your content than just your blog. In other systems people would get around limitations by making everything a post and playing with templates in bizarre ways, which you can do with WordPress too, but sometimes you donâ€™t want a template or another postâ€”you want a <strong>page</strong>. In 1.5 we added the â€œpagesâ€ feature which allows you to run your entire site through WordPress, if you want. For example, you could create a page called â€œAboutâ€ and it would be automatically added to your sidebar and the link would be <code>example.com/about/</code> and then you could create a sub-page of that called â€œMy Dogâ€ which would live at <code>/about/my-dog/</code>. You can have two pages or a thousand, manage your blog and a few photo pages or an entire corporate intranet 20 levels deep.</p>\r\n<h4>Keep Up With the Latest</h4>\r\n<p>The new <strong>Dashboard</strong> feature in your admin panel keeps you up to date with the latest happenings on your blog and the most important news from around the WordPress world, keeping you connect to the latest developments, updates, news, and enhancements.</p>\r\n<h4>Thereâ€™s More Stillâ€¦</h4>\r\n<p>There are tons of things that for whatever reason just arenâ€™t right for the core WordPress distribution, but thatâ€™s okay. You want us to stay small and fast and we want you to have every feature you could possibly imagine, which is why weâ€™ve expanded the internal API for plugin developers to use by hundreds of â€œhooksâ€ into the very deepest parts of WordPress. Plugins can now integrate with the rest of the administration interface easily and do more then they ever could before. Weâ€™ve also created a great <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/development/2005/01/the-wordpress-plugin-repository/\">collaborative enviroment for plugin developers</a> to create plugins just like WordPress is developed, and moving forward weâ€™ll be creating an easy user interface for you to find and use the hundreds of plugins available for WordPress.</p>\r\n<h4>Under the Hood</h4>\r\n<p>In addition to all of the features above, we made significant improvements and optimizations to core pieces of WordPress code, following our â€œCode is Poetryâ€ mantra. Amazingly, if you remove the extra templates we ship with now, this release of WordPress is actually <strong>smaller</strong> than 1.2, despite adding dozens of new features. Our testing team gave the code a thorough workout too â€” hundreds and hundreds of bugs have been fixed since 1.2.2. WordPress is now leaner, faster, and more secure then ever before, and weâ€™re committed to continuing that trend.</p>\r\n<h4>Go Get It!</h4>\r\n<p>This has been the longest announcement post weâ€™ve ever done, and we still havenâ€™t covered half of whatâ€™s great about 1.5, for example built-in podcasting support. The best way to get the Strayhorn experience is just to <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/download/\">dive in and download it</a>. After all, the price is right. I apologize if I gushed a little, Iâ€™m just so excited and proud of what the WordPress team has done thatâ€™s hard to contain my enthusiasm. Iâ€™m really proud to be part of something so many of you are choosing to make a part of your lives.</p>\r\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2005/02/strayhorn/?share=twitter&amp;nb=1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\" id=\"sharing-twitter-151\"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2005/02/strayhorn/?share=facebook&amp;nb=1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share on Facebook\" id=\"sharing-facebook-151\"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=\"share-google-plus-1\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"share-google-plus-1 sd-button share-icon\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2005/02/strayhorn/?share=google-plus-1&amp;nb=1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Google+\" id=\"sharing-google-151\"><span>Google +1</span></a></li><li class=\"share-email share-service-visible\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"share-email sd-button share-icon\" href=\"http://wordpress.org/news/2005/02/strayhorn/?share=email&amp;nb=1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to email this to a friend\"><span>Email</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul><div class=\"sharing-clear\"></div></div></div></div></div>','Announcing WordPress 1.5',0,'','publish','open','open','','announcing-wordpress-15','','','2013-05-25 18:08:29','2013-05-25 18:08:29','',0,'http://wp-archive.local/1.5.0/?p=2',0);
